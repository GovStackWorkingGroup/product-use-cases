# INST-3 - Citizen Engagement

## Product Use Case Summary

| ID      | INST-3             |
| ------- | -----------------  |
| Name    | Citizen Engagement |
| Sector  | Institution        |
| Version | 1.0                |
| Status  | Draft.             |

This use case profiles the implementation of a digitized citizen engagement process by a public institution. A digital service that assists public institutions in facilitating a process of engaging citizens on a particular policy matter for different purposes – to inform citizens, to consult citizens and get feedback or to co-create new strategies, action plans, policies together. The participation process can range across different levels of public institutions – from local, provincial, national to regional engagements. The focus of the citizen engagement process can range across various sectors (health, education, transport, urban planning, infrastructure development). 

This process is how public institutions can make sure that good governance principles of citizen orientation and feedback are implemented on a practical level. It touches on both - mandatory participation processes (e.g. (e.g. participation in development or urban planning in some country contexts) and voluntary-initiated processes by public institutions. Citizen engagement is a crucial foundation for achieving SDG 16 on accountable public institutions. It helps to make policies more oriented towards the actual needs of citizens and create opportunities for holding decision-makers accountable. In general, citizen engagement refers to ways, activities or processes for involving citizens in the public policy process.

So far, many public institutions mostly focus on face-to-face formats of engaging citizens. This excludes many citizens that e.g. live in the Diaspora, are physically or mentally not able to participate or are – due to existing power structures in communities – not allowed to raise their voice. A digital service for different citizen engagement functions with user-friendly tools can be an important complementary aspect to facilitate inclusive citizen engagement. A digital service should always be applied complementary to existing and functioning face-to-face formats (blended approach).

## Steps

### 1 - Identification of Citizen Engagement Process

Responsible staff from respective public institutions firstly need to identify the specific participation process they would like to use the digital service for. Importantly, different questions need to be answered before starting a citizen engagement process. These range from the actual focus of engagement process (topic, policy, strategy, plan), level of engagement envisioned (informing, consulting, co-creationg), available budget, timeframe for engagement period, responsible officials, envisioned outcome of process, to suitable feedback mechanism after conclusion of engagement process. These are internal decision-making processes that involve the responsible officials and decision-makers in public institutions. This process results in a particular participation strategy. This participation strategy also includes information on which engagement formats shall be used i.e. for which aspects a digital service for engagement shall be used and which face-to-face formats shall complement the digital service. 

Once a participation strategy for the process is in place, the operationalization starts by selecting setting up the relevant content for engagement and selecting the relevant engagement tools. From the methodological digital toolbox for citizen engagement, the responsible official select the relevant tools (e.g. document consultation, survey, proposal-making). 


**Workflows**

* **Strategy development**: Development of participation strategy with information on budget, timelines, objective
* **Selection and Identification** of relevant digital tools for citizen engagement (e.g. proposal-making, survey, document consultation)
* **Content Management** for the development of the respective content on the digital service (incl. information on policy, timelines, process design) 
* **Staff Communication and Education**: Technical training of responsible officials in digital service content management

### 2 - Communication and Marketing of Process

Responsible officials for the respective engagement process develop relevant communication material to inform the target group of the planned digital engagement process. This is an important step and often under-estimated. A targeted communication campaign needs to be set up to share information about the digital engagement process. Roll out of this can be facilitated via the institution’s website, social media channels. In addition, multipliers such as think tanks and civil society organisations should be targeted directly via promotional communication material (e.g. brochures, flyers). If a specific engagement process targets a specific group (e.g. specific sector experts), then intentional outreach and communication should be facilitated. 

During this process step, it is important that all information provided is consistent with information provided on the digital service for engagement. The content provided on the digital service needs to be very specific: What is the objective of the engagement process, how can citizens participate, how will the results be used, how will citizens get feedback once the process is concluded. 

This process step also involves awareness-raising and training in different forms. On the one hand, all involved officials should be trained on the digital service for citizen engagement – ideally on basis of a user manual. On the other hand, there should be easily-to-understand information material on how to use the citizen engagement platform, if relevant also in different local languages. 

**Workflows**

* **Client Communication** to facilitate information dissemination on the new digitized citizen engagement platform (via websites, social media, multipliers)
* **Awareness and Education for Citizens** (e.g. tutorial, explanatory videos) on how to use newly digitized citizen engagement platform  
* **Content Management** for the development of a user manual and training guide on the digitized service for officials responsible for facilitating citizen engagement process
* **Identification and Registration** for providing an administration account for all relevant public officials involved in specific engagement process

### 3 - Engagement Access and Registration

In general, there are two options for engaging citizens on a particular process or topic: open engagement with no registration, or engagement with the condition of registering on the citizen engagement platform. If the public institutions ask for a registration of citizens to be able to participate, an intentional decision needs to be made as to which data is collected. Depending on the content, the following data might be inserted by citizens to participate: full name, email, phone number. Citizens might then have to register on the platform in order to generate personalized login credentials. With these credentials the user can then participate in the specific digitized engagement tools (e.g. document consultation, survey function, proposal-making). If this option is pursued, there should be a targeted data-minimization approach, ensuring that only relevant information on users is collected. Also, information needs to be provided in an easily understandable language how data is stored and how has access to it. If not set up in a transparent manner, it will deter people from engaging on the digitized platform. 

If an open engagement process is facilitated, citizens normally can – without any log-in credentials – submit their ideas, comments, feedback on the respective digitized citizen platform. 

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing, managing and evaluating registration application data submitted, and in some cases - allocating personalized login credentials per user.
* **Identification** to easily be able to identify and track registered users.
* **Client Case Management** to help automate and manage the registration process, and respond to any inquiries or issues around registering on the platform.

### 4 - Digital Engagement Process

The actual digitized citizen engagement process takes place when citizens use the tools provided by the digital service to submit their ideas, comments, feedback. Depending on the level of engagement (information, consultation, co-creation), citizens will be able to use different tools provided on the digitized service. Commonly used digital functions for citizen engagement are document consultation, survey function, proposal-making/idea submission. 

In general, a typical engagement process looks as follows: citizens will access the digitized citizen engagement platform on their mobile or desk-based. They will engage with the information on the engagement process, read through the objectives, the timelines and the specific format of engagement. If provided information and context creates a good enough understanding of why citizens should contribute towards this policy process, a diverse range of practical options for engagement are possible. 

A comprehensive digital citizen engagement platforms allows for a diversity of digital functions of engagement. Benchmarking citizen engagement practices across the globe, the following functions are common digital functions for engagement:  

**Proposal-making**

The function allows for citizens to submit their own ideas and discuss the ideas of others. The so-called proposal-making function/ or idea submission functions asks citizens to submit an idea title, a short idea description, budget estimate (if project-related), and depending on the engagement process further details. This function is often used in the context of asking for submissions for new strategies, action plans or in the context of public planning processes (e.g. priorities identification for neighborhoods). The function normally integrates the following: text field, tags, picture upload, title. Once an idea or proposal is uploaded, it is published for other citizens to engage with. Normally other participants can comment on an idea/proposal (comment function), sometimes a thumbs-up option is integrated. In the back-end of this engagement function, policy-makers will be able to see all submitted ideas, see reactions of others and be able to extract/download a summary of submitted ideas for further consideration. Overall, this function allows for the collection of completely new ideas and perspectives. 

**Document consultation**

The function allows for citizens to comment on existing texts. The so-called document consultation function asks citizens to look at existing text (policy, strategy, law) and provide feedback through integrating comments. The document consultation function is a simple instrument of getting feedback on an existing text. Citizens can be asked to provide comments or amendments to a legal text or policy or strategy. This function allows to look at existing text and use a comment function to include feedback, further input or alternative suggestions. Once a comment is published, it is visible to other participants to allow for transparency. In the back-end of this function, policy-makers will be able to aggregate a summary report on all submitted comments and ideas for the respective text. Overall, this function allows policy-makers to collect feedback and comment on an existing policy process. 

**Survey**

The function allows for citizens to answer simple questions to give quick and easy feedback on a policy process. The survey function allows for policy-makers to ask a series of simple questions to get quick insights into a policy question. The function normally allows for a range of question types (closed, open, multiple choice questions). The survey function is a low-threshold form of participation since users only need to click and submit. This function is relevant if policy-makers are interested in getting short and concise insights into a particular policy question. In the back-end policy-makers will be able to see aggregated results from different survey questions. 

Importantly, listed functions can be combined for a particular engagement process. 

Once users have submitted their inputs using the respective tools, they are able to see their submission on the platform. Depending on the registration requirements, they might be able to get updates via email if e.g. another user has commented on an idea, or an update to a text is made. Users would then also be informed when an engagement activity is closed i.e. comments, submissions are no longer possible. The digitized citizen engagement platform serves as a platform for transparency to monitor the engagement process, its different inputs as well as how results are communicated to users. 

**Workflows**

* **Content Management** to help update the information provided on the respective citizen engagement process if necessary.
* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing and evaluating data submitted by the user 
* **Updates and Client Communication** to share updates on the engagement process (via mail, SMS) Building Blocks

### 5 - Data Verification and Aggregation

Once a specific citizen engagement process or activity has ended officially, responsible public officials need to analyse the provided inputs or comments. They will access the back-end data on the digitized citizen engagement platform in order to see the provided inputs. 

The data is generally checked by officials that have responsibility for the engagement process. Depending on the type of tool used (survey, document consultation, proposal-making) data will be assessed and analysed with different tools and formats (survey – statistical analysis, document consultation – overview document of all comments, proposal-making – automatically-generated overview document with all ideas). 

**Workflows**

* **Content Management** for storing and reviewing registration, and construction permit application records.
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for analysis of provided inputs and data (dashboard visualization, table format, document format)

### 6 - Consolidation and Communication of Feedback

Depending on the type of citizen engagement process (mandatory or informal), the hosting public institutions will aggregate and consolidate all inputs received. The inputs will be assessed against criteria that should be publicly communicated. In the case of the proposal-making function this could be i.a. costs involved of submitted idea, impact/effect of idea on broader community vs. only service a particular community, timeframe for implementing idea, environmental and ecological dimensions of implementation. When selecting certain ideas, the responsible public officials should indicate on the digitized service why certain ideas were chosen and others not. In the case of a document consultation, all provided comments and input should be transferred to the policy experts for further consideration. Often these can also have legal implications or touch on specific mandates and responsibilities of public institutions. 

In the different cases, responsible public officials should use the digitized citizen engagement platform to communicate the results i.e. how the inputs were further used and what the next steps will be. Users could receive – in the case of registration requirements – an automated update (email, SMS) that there is new information on an engagement activity. 

**Workflows**

* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for aggregating and consolidation provided inputs on specific engagement activity.  
* **Content Management** for updating the respective citizen engagement activity on the platform.

### 7 - Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation

During the digitized citizen engagement process, it is important that responsible public officials monitor the engagement rate and submission of inputs. Only through continuous monitoring the respective public institutions can actually assess whether citizens are really engaging on the content and providing inputs. If – during the process – the number of inputs stay low, it is necessary to intensify communication and outreach to ensure citizens are mobilized to participate and provide their ideas. 

Good data collection on the overall development of engagement rate during a specific engagement activity can provide important lessons learnt for the next process. The dashboard of the digitized citizen engagement platform can provide this data. 

**Workflows**

* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for analysis the engagement rate during a specific engagement activity (e.g. number of inputs, number of users, geographic origin, lengths of engagement, etc.).
