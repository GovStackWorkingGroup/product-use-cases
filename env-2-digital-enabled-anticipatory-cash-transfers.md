The primary agent aims to leverage digital technologies and data-driven approaches to implement anticipatory cash transfers, providing timely financial assistance to vulnerable populations in high-risk areas prone to natural disasters.

Anticipatory cash transfers (or forecast-based financing) are a social protection mechanism to protect people from climate and human-induced disasters. Anticipatory action in the form of a cash transfer provides support to people before a disaster has struck, as an investment in prevention and resiliency, rather than recovery. Early response is a more dignified way of supporting communities and is more cost-effective than rebuilding efforts, but they vary in scope and are highly time-sensitive and connected to forecasts. This use case considers leveraging digital to streamline ACTs in climate disaster scenarios..

## Stakeholders

### 3 - Design program&#x20;

Define the program's objectives, scope, and eligibility criteria. Determine the trigger mechanisms for initiating cash transfers based on early warning indicators and establish the frequency and duration of assistance. Set the cash transfer amount based on the identified needs and available resources. The trigger mechanisms need to be based on 1) available data and forecasts of emergency climate scenarios and 2) an agreed definition of impact level. The agent needs to coordinate with government stakeholders to be able to response to the governments existing early warning system.

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Data analysis and business intelligence** to implement the trigger which responds to incoming data from government's early warning system.
* **Decision support** to automate the trigger mechanism based on the agreed-upon impact level.
* **Remote monitoring** by the government of weather patterns and other climate emergencies

### 5 - Establish digital payment system

Identify and establish partnerships with digital payment service providers or mobile network operators to facilitate cash disbursements. Integrate the chosen digital payment system into the program's infrastructure and ensure compatibility with the local context and beneficiaries' preferences. This process requires formal contracting with service providers.

### 11 - Piloting and Iteration

Initiate a small-scale pilot implementation of the digital anticipatory cash transfer program to test its effectiveness, identify operational challenges, and gather feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders. Based on the lessons learned, refine and iterate the program design and processes. Additionally, this step involves conducting training sessions for program implementers, local staff, and beneficiaries on the use of digital tools, mobile applications, and the cash transfer process. Ensure that all stakeholders have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively participate in the program.

**Workflows**

* **Client communication** to ensure stakeholders are involved and are participating.&#x20;
* **Client education** to ensure that appropriate capacity exists for program implementers and beneficiaries.&#x20;
* **Content management** to develop relevant training guides and manuals.&#x20;
* **Financial Services** for processing beneficiary payment directly to their account, or for generating payroll to deposit payment amounts for withdrawal by beneficiary from designated banking institution(s) / pay-point(s) thereafter
* **Client Case Management** for identifying and authenticating individual that is making a withdrawal, or to recall / verify deposit account information prior to payment transaction
