<table><thead><tr><th width="305.5">ID</th><th>FINC-2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Inclusive Financial Services for SMEs</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>Finance</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Draft</td></tr></tbody></table>

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) represent the economic backbone of most developed and emerging countries. Yet they face a number of hurdles in acquiring loans/credits and financing from traditional financial institutions. Thus, access to finance is a critical barrier for SMEs to start, sustain and grow their businesses. Information asymmetry due to the lack of available financial and credit data is also a major obstacle for SME to access financing. Many SMEs do not have reliable financial statements and/or are unregistered and have no official documentation when compared to large enterprises, making it difficult for financiers to appropriately evaluate and monitor credit risk.

This use case profiles how digital technologies can help address the barriers to financing for SMEs, and address information asymmetry issues lenders face. Digitization in this use case can range from the use of alternative data sources and big-data analytics to facilitate credit risk-assessment process for SMEs. To the use of fintech solutions SMEs to obtain financing i.e., digital credit and equity products such as loans, supply chain finance, secured revolving lines of credit, merchant receivables finance, marketplace lending, as well as equity crowdfunding.&#x20;

Guarantees to SME loans appear to be the most widespread instrument, with guarantee funds mentioned by almost all countries, and as the main pillar of support for SME lending

raising SME awareness of programmes for which they may be eligible, and do so through dedicated websites or awareness campaigns.

**Workflows**

* **Coordination** to have an agreed form of coordination, communication and collaboration between the Chambers of Commerce and Tax Administration - facilitating information sharing on businesses operating in the country.
* **Education** for educating and training all relevant government staff on new process and platform/solution being utilized. Emphasis on objective, process, guidelines, and benefits - time saving and easy usability.
* **Content management** for the staff to acquire technical and nontechnical guidelines on how to use platform.

### 2 - Outreach Communications

Encouraging SMEs - the digitization of internal business processes and business-to-business (B2B) processes such as electronic invoicing (e-invoicing), and tokenized assets using blockchain/distributed ledger technology (DLT), can also help address the major barriers to SME access to finance.

For communication with the target business entity taxpayers - the tax administration implements a robust awareness raising campaign via telephone, email (i.e., Chambers of Commerce registered business entities contact database), SMS, newspapers, and social media. The purpose is to inform this target group about the new and mandatory digitized tax reporting process with clear guidelines and initial support on how to file taxes electronically using the platform in place. All information on the tax reporting platform should already be easily accessible and disseminated on all government run websites including in the Chambers of Commerce website, - timeframe to register, tax submission steps and requirements, deadlines, pre-filled standard form to declare revenue, expenses etc. Certain countries have a grace period of 1-3 years by which all businesses are required to transition to electronic invoicing (instead of cash-based transactions) to streamline and automate tax filing and reporting process.

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client communication** to facilitate awareness of the tax platform for target audience and mandatory registration and enrollment process.&#x20;
* **Client education** for educating target users/audience on the objective(s), benefit(s), process, guideline etc.
* **Content management** for the staff  to generate relevant educational and promotional content.

For the e-tax system, in certain countries, the registration data that is submitted for tax purposes, is checked against other government databases (e.g. chamber of commerce business registry, etc.) to fill in any missing gaps, verify and validate collected information, including authentication of all records.&#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification, registration, and business registration records for tax purposes.

### &#x20;5 - Registration Fee

make the credit approval process more transparent to SMEs. In one country, banks have an obligation to provide SMEs with a standardised credit report and with their credit rating, based on a common methodology. Another country has put in place a credit review office, providing a credit appeals process for SMEs. The credit review office is meant to help SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to three million euros declined or reduced by participating banks, but feel that they have a viable business proposition. It also looks at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment



**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for identifying, authenticating and monitoring/verifying that the registration information and fee have been fully processed and received.

### 7 - Tax Payment&#x20;

The amount of taxes a business pays can depend on the type of business, the nature of the business activity, and the volume of transactions carried out within the tax assessment period. In some countries, businesses must adhere to several domestic and business taxes including corporate income tax, value-added taxes, withholding taxes, and capital gains taxes. Thus, business taxes are calculated per the specific norms of a country.&#x20;

The tax platform used can automate the tax calculation process by taking into account the tax regime and rate in the country, and the business's profit, revenue, expenses, and other relevant tax filing information submitted. The business is then allocated a timeframe in which to make this tax payment. The tax payment can be paid in one lump sum or installments.&#x20;

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** to track, manage and calculate tax payment per business. Also, to respond to any inquiries or support needs.
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** to analyze all submitted data and ensure tax payment requirements are met.

### 8 - Audit&#x20;

Tax audit is the processing of reviewing/examining a business' accounts and financial information to ensure all information is reported correctly according to the tax laws and to verify the reported amount of tax is correct. This can be done via random selection and computer screening, where submitted tax returns are selected based solely on a statistical formula. Selection can also be made when it involves issues or transactions with other taxpayers, such as business partners or investors, whose returns were selected for audit.&#x20;

An experienced auditor will then manually review the submitted tax information. If the auditor notes something questionable, they will identify the items noted and forward the return for assignment to an examination group. Should a business be selected for audit, they will be notified via mail and/or on the tax platform. Following completion of the audit, the business entity should be notified of the outcome - whether changes are required and/or if additional money is owed.

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for communicating with businesses selected for audit: providing them with updates, requesting additional information and/or meetings. Also responding to inquiries, capturing reported cases on grievances / appeals etc., and for determining risks / conditionality by reviewing individual audit cases in-depth.
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** to analyze and review all cases selected for audit.
