# FINC-2 - Inclusive Financial Services for SMEs

## Product Use Case Summary

<table><thead><tr><th width="305.5">ID</th><th>FINC-2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Inclusive Financial Services for SMEs</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>Finance</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Draft</td></tr></tbody></table>

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) represent the economic backbone of most developed and emerging countries. Yet they face a number of hurdles in acquiring loans/credits and financing from traditional financial institutions. Thus, access to finance is a critical barrier for SMEs to start, sustain and grow their businesses. For lenders, information asymmetry on the financial and credit data of SMEs, leads to their high lending interest rates and higher rejection rates of loan applications by SMEs. Many SMEs do not have reliable financial statements and/or are unregistered and have no official documentation when compared to large enterprises, making it difficult for financiers to appropriately evaluate and monitor credit risk.

This use case profiles how  streamlined loan programs targeting SMEs and digital technologies can supporting access to financing for SMEs, and address information asymmetry and collateral requirements in lending markets. Digitization in this use case can range from the use of alternative data sources and big-data analytics to facilitate credit risk-assessment processes for SMEs. It can also mean the use of fintech solutions to facilitate SMEs access to financing i.e., digital credit and equity products such as loans, marketplace lending, and/or equity crowdfunding.&#x20;

## Steps

### 1 - Coordination&#x20;

The Ministry of Finance and/or the Central Bank/public financial institution coordinate on targeted efforts to strengthen SMEs access to traditional or mainstream financial services and products. These public authorities can liaise with private sector players - commercial banks etc., private equity, venture capital or angel capital business associations, on best approach - methods and tools to facilitate SME financing.&#x20;

Certain countries have implemented SME credit guarantee schemes, where a government body/ministry stands as guarantor for eligible SMEs applying for loans. This credit scheme increases the SME’s collateral and thus their financing options. Another example is lending to SMEs through a factoring platform. Factoring is a financing product that allows a financial institution to provide financing to an SME supplier through the purchase of its accounts receivable or invoices (“receivables”). In factoring transactions, the SME supplier is the client of the financial institution.

**Workflows**

* **Coordination** to have an agreed form of coordination, communication and collaboration between public and commercial financial institutions.
* **Education** for educating and training all relevant staff on use of digital solutions and any guarantee scheme programs to facilitate credit lending to SMEs.
* **Content management** for content development of technical and nontechnical guidelines.

### 2 - Outreach Communications

This step entails launching an awareness campaign about a new loan program initiative targeting SMEs. Information on the program, which SMEs are eligible and processes to obtain the credit loan are disseminated through all sources of media - television, radio, SMS, email, and social media platforms.&#x20;

Targeted outreach can also be done via existing databases and registries of operating SMEs in the country. These SMEs should be encouraged to digitize all their internal and business-to-business (B2B) processes on their business activities and cash flows - this will facilitate the automation of credit-risk measurement and monitoring that lenders value.

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client communication** to facilitate clear information and communication on processes to apply for credit and loans targeting SMEs.&#x20;
* **Client education** for educating target users/audience on the objective(s), benefit(s), process, guideline etc.
* **Content management** to disseminate relevant educational and promotional content that local loan officers can use at banks, financing institutions etc. &#x20;

### 3 - Registration&#x20;

Registration is the process of collecting information on potential SMEs seeking to apply for financing and go through a credit approval process. This is in order to gather all the necessary information needed for assessment of their needs and conditions. Depending on the specific country context, registration may occur by leveraging an existing business registry database - national SME business registry to acquire all information the lending financial institution requires to assess a loan application. During this process, the business entity's information is collected (type of enterprise, business model, financial documents, collateral etc.) as a prerequisite in assessing their eligibility for a particular loan/ financing scheme. &#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing data of SME business entities.&#x20;
* **Identification and Registration** to be able to identify the SMEs.&#x20;
* **Client Case Management** for creating business entity user records.

### 4 - Data Verification and Validation

Data verification and validation should be coordinated with all relevant authorities and participating lending financial institutions. The SME registration data that is submitted can be checked against other credit institutions and government databases (e.g. chamber of commerce business registry, etc.) to fill in any missing gaps, verify and validate collected information, including authentication of all records.&#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification, registration, and SMEs credit scores and financial information.&#x20;
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for cross-referencing and verifying records across multiple registry sources, and reconciling gaps / overlaps.

### &#x20;5 - Eligibility Determination&#x20;

To be eligible for the SME credit guarantee scheme or any public funding scheme, SMEs generally have to fulfil various conditions. Eligibility conditions are very clear and information on criteria is made easily accessible. These conditions could include requirements on where the business is established, number of employees, years the business has been in operation, annual revenue and balance sheets, revenue thresholds, etc.&#x20;

For example in the case of a government credit guarantee funding scheme, a list of the banks and other possible funders that are participating in this funding scheme with the governement body, are readily make available on a website, and disseminated on television and social media platforms. A special web portal can be made available for SMEs as well as funders with all relevant information.

**Workflows**

* **Content management** to disseminate information of eligibility criteria. &#x20;
* **Identification and Registration** for identifying eligible beneficiaries
* **Client Case Management** for storing specific data for tracking.

### 6 - Application

SMEs do not apply for the SME Credit Guarantee themselves. They simply apply for a loan from one of the participating banks or other funders collaborating on this scheme. which in turn submits an application for the SME credit guarantee from the national body acting as gurantor.

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** to track, review and process all submitted tax related documents. Also, to respond to any inquiries or support needs from business owners/accounting team.
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** to analyze all submitted data and ensure they meet tax compliance obligations.

### 7 - Credit Case Management

In certain countries, banks have an obligation to provide SMEs with a standardised credit report and with their credit rating, based on a common methodology. Some countries have put in place credit review offices, providing a credit appeals process for SMEs. The credit review office is meant to help SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to a certain amount, declined or reduced by participating banks, but feel that they have a viable business proposition. It also looks at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for identifying and recording business entity interactions with local officers and capturing reported cases on grievances / appeals etc., and for determining risks / conditionality by reviewing individual client case.
* **Work Planning and Coordination** to potentially suggest and connect with Chambers of Commerce in data validation/vetting.
