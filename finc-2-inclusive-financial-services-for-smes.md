<table><thead><tr><th width="305.5">ID</th><th>FINC-2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Inclusive Financial Services for SMEs</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>Finance</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Draft</td></tr></tbody></table>

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) represent the economic backbone of most developed and emerging countries. Yet they face a number of hurdles in acquiring loans/credits and financing from traditional financial institutions. Thus, access to finance is a critical barrier for SMEs to start, sustain and grow their businesses. Information asymmetry due to the lack of available financial and credit data is also a major obstacle for SME to access financing. Many SMEs do not have reliable financial statements and/or are unregistered and have no official documentation when compared to large enterprises, making it difficult for financiers to appropriately evaluate and monitor credit risk.

This use case profiles how digital technologies can help address the barriers to financing for SMEs, and address information asymmetry issues lenders face. Digitization in this use case can range from the use of alternative data sources and big-data analytics to facilitate credit risk-assessment process for SMEs. To the use of fintech solutions SMEs to obtain financing i.e., digital credit and equity products such as loans, supply chain finance, secured revolving lines of credit, merchant receivables finance, marketplace lending, as well as equity crowdfunding.&#x20;

## Steps

### 1 - Coordination&#x20;

The Ministry of Finance, the national SME agency, the Central Bank/public financial institution coordinate on targeted efforts to strengthen SME access to traditional or mainstream financial services and products. These public authorities can liase with private sector players - banks etc, private equity, venture capital or angel capital business associations, on best approach - methods and tools to faciliate SME financing. A number of countries have implemented SME credit guarantee schemes, where a government body/ministry  stands as gurantor for eligible SMEs applying for loans. This credit scheme increases the SME’s collateral and thus their financing options.

**Workflows**

* **Coordination** to have an agreed form of coordination, communication and collaboration between public and commercial financial institutions.
* **Education** for educating and training all relevant staff on use of digital solutions and any guarantee scheme programs to faciliate credit lending to SMEs.
* **Content management** for content development of technical and nontechnical guidelines.

### 2 - Outreach Communications

This step entails raising SME awareness of programmes and funding schemes for which they may be eligible and do so through dedicated websites or awareness campaigns. Using both targeted and widespread awareness campaigns to launch a proactive information dissemination through SMS, email, and social media.&#x20;

Targated outreach can also be done via exisiting data base and registries of operating SMEs in the country. These SMEs can also be encouraged to make sure they are digitizing their internal business processes and business-to-business (B2B) processes via electronic invoicing (e-invoicing), and tokenized assets using blockchain/distributed ledger technology (DLT).

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client communication** to facilitate clear information and communication on processes to apply for credit and loans targeting SMEs.&#x20;
* **Client education** for educating target users/audience on the objective(s), benefit(s), process, guideline etc.
* **Content management** to disseminate relevant educational and promotional content that local loan officers can use at banks, financing institutions etc. &#x20;

### 3 - Registration&#x20;

Registration is the process of collecting information on potential SMEs seeking to apply for financing and go through a credit approval process. This is in order to gather all the necessary information needed for assessment of their needs and conditions. Depending on specific country context, registration may occur by leveraging an existing business registry database or through on-demand registration, which would require the lending financial institution to collect registration data of SMEs.  During this process, the business entity's information is collected ( type of enterprise, business model, financial documents, collateral etc.) as a prerequisite in assessing their eligibility for a particular loan/ financing scheme. &#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing data of SME business entities.&#x20;
* **Identification and Registration** to be able to identify the SMEs.&#x20;
* **Client Case Management** for creating business entity user records.

### 4 - Data Verification and Validation

Data verification and validation should be coordinated with all relevant authorities and regulatory bodies. The registration data that is submitted can be checked against other credit institutions and government databases (e.g. chamber of commerce business registry, etc.) to fill in any missing gaps, verify and validate collected information, including authentication of all records.&#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification, registration, and SMEs credit scores and financial information.&#x20;

### 7 - Credit Case Management

In certain countries, banks have an obligation to provide SMEs with a standardised credit report and with their credit rating, based on a common methodology. Some countries have put in place credit review offices, providing a credit appeals process for SMEs. The credit review office is meant to help SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to a certain amount, declined or reduced by participating banks, but feel that they have a viable business proposition. It also looks at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for identifying and recording business entity interactions with local officers and capturing reported cases on grievances / appeals etc., and for determining risks / conditionality by reviewing individual client case.
* **Work Planning and Coordination** to potentially suggest and connect with Chambers of Commerce in data validation/vetting.

### 8 - Ongoing M\&E&#x20;

The primary agent should conduct M\&E exercises to acquire feedback from all relevant stakeholders on ways to improve the platform and ensure tax submissions are as streamlined, effective and efficient as possible.&#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for ongoing monitoring and tracking of platform performance, and integration to other registries for holistic view and reporting.
