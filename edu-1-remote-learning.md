## Steps

### 1 - Registration&#x20;

Educators register on the platform by providing their credentials, teaching experience, and expertise. Their accounts are verified and approved by administrators. Students register on the platform by providing basic personal information. User accounts are created, allowing access to course offerings and other platform features.

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing interview responses or observation during registration process
* **Identification and Registration** for enrolled identified beneficiaries in the system and enabling possible permissions for interaction with the SRIS, and (with aid of geographic information services tool) to potentially locate and track households during the interview process
* **Client Case Management** for creating beneficiary user records

### 3 - Data Verification and Validation&#x20;

Accounts are verified and approved by administrators, including setting permissions based on the user profile. For example, educators will have access to course creation features and will have grade visibility of all students. Students will have a view that supports their personal learning. Using advanced identity verification mechanisms, such as email confirmation or multi-factor authentication will ensure the accuracy of user-provided information and prevent unauthorized access.

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification records and eligibility information of potential beneficiaries
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for cross-referencing and verifying records across multiple registry sources, and reconciling gaps / overlaps

### 2 - Payment&#x20;

In some cases, payment will be required as part of the course (such as for MOOCs). In other cases, payment may be collected at registration and will be external to the learning management system. If payment is required, the platform can facilitate secure online payment options for course enrollment, or the student may be be requested to travel to the nearest designated pay-point and pay in person.

**Workflows**

* **Financial Services** for processing beneficiary payment directly to their account, or for generating payroll to deposit payment amounts for withdrawal by beneficiary from designated banking institution(s) / pay-point(s) thereafter
* **Client Case Management** for identifying and authenticating individual that is making a withdrawal, or to recall / verify deposit account information prior to payment transaction
