This use case provides step by step guidelines on how to implement the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system of waste from electrical and electronic equipments (also known as e-waste). **EPR** is an environmental policy approach that regulates a producer’s responsibility for a product throughout the product’s life cycle. Improper disposal of e-waste poses numerous threats to the environment, economy, and health and well-being of citizens. Under the EPR approach, a producer takes the responsibility for financing **collection**, **recycling** and end-of-life **disposal** of e-waste equipment/product streams - batteries, small consumer electronics, accumulators, packaging and other EPR product categories - in order to mitigate the environmental impacts of their products throughout the entire product life cycle. It thereby aims to increase the separate collection of end-of-life products and to enable their more circular treatment.

Implementing EPR can create various environmental, economical and social benefits. Example of EPR benefits include - improved waste collection and treatment, higher rates of waste reuse and recycling, incentivizing greener products, helping to finance waste collection and processing, and generally promoting a sustainable management of waste and circular economy. Governments in low- and middle-income countries are increasingly interested in implementing the EPR in various forms, through a system where they: define the products covered, the producers affected, the obligations imposed on producers - targets and fees, disseminate information on EPR and e-waste to stakeholders and citizens, and have a process to ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of the EPR.&#x20;

### Steps

#### 1 - Outreach and EPR Framework&#x20;

The Ministry of Environment or relevant Ministry, should coordinate with relevant authorities i.e. the Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Revenues Authority etc., to develop and establish a legal **EPR Framework and Implementation Plan** that outlines the responsibilities and role of these authorities. The EPR framework should include key clauses on scope of obligated products, stakeholder roles and responsibilities, financing mechanism, targets, penalties, authorization procedure, reporting, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. To formulate this document, the Ministry can map policies and learnings from other countries, evaluate e-waste quantities and flows with their country, analyze waste management infrastructure and skills, as well as existing policies and legislation at national and sub-national level.&#x20;

As a next step, the draft Framework can be shared with a core group of diverse stakeholders including other government authorities, civil society actors, and private sector actors that are electrical and electronic equipment producers (importers, distributors, manufacturers and resellers) - to review and comment on the draft document via workshop format sessions. A co-creation session with this group around the registration and EPR fee payment procedure would be very useful to acquire input from producers, and promote a user-friendly EPR designed process.

&#x20;**Workflows**

* **Client education** for educating and/or informing producers (e.g. an importer, manufacturer, distributor or reseller) on the EPR requirements and legal framework, as well as sustainable e-waste management and collection systems they are recommended to implement.
* **Client communication** to facilitate information dissemination of the EPR Framework and electrical and electronic product license and registration process via government and business registration websites, mobile / media channel(s)
  * Country wide campaign to increase awareness amongst local population about how and where to drop off old electrical and electronic equipment and the status of e-waste collection and management in the country.
* **Identification and Registration** where target producers register with the relevant Regulatory Authority of the EPR system - the electricals and electronics they intend to introduce (new or used) into the market. Producers to then be allocated a certificate of approval with an EPR registration and/or license number for identification purposes.&#x20;
* **Content management** for the backend EPR Regulatory and Revenue Authorities to populate and track the following producer registration/licensing types:
  * Electronic manufacturers;
  * E-waste importers;
  * E waste management and recycling companies.

#### 2 - Registration

Registration is the process of documenting and maintaining records of licensed and registered producers and their electrical and electronic products (new or used) they are either manufacturing, distributing, importing and/or selling in the market. All producers of these e-waste goods/services should register in order to obtain an EPR certification of approval and registration number. This should be required as part of the business operator licensing and product registration approval process.  Producers should not be allowed to sell these product(s) without **having obtained some form of EPR registration/identification number.**&#x20;

In certain countries, they follow a specific product registration process where the producer completes a registration application form and pays an EPR e-waste management registration fee. Producers provide the following documents as part of the licensing and registration of their product(s) that are subject to EPR:

* Filled and signed application form and formal agreement to conform to EPR regulations;
* Copy of business registration certificate issued by the Competent Authority;
* Copy of existing operational license issued by the Regulatory Authority (if any);
* Detailed information on the estimated product(s) life span;
* The product(s) user manual, installation instructions;
* Amount of electrical and electronic equipment they plan to put on the market in a given year;
* Environmental impact assessment certificate from the Competent Authority (if applicable);&#x20;
* Efficient facilities (storage, transport, production facility, …);&#x20;
* Proof of Tax Clearance;
* Proof of Social Security Clearance Certificate;
* Proof of payment of applicable fees.

Through this process, the relevant authority can track e-waste products in the market and EPR payments from the producers.

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing the registration of producers in to the EPR system, and their approved and registered e-waste product(s).
* **Identification and Registration** for locating and tracking e-waste products being introduced into the market in all phases of their life cycle.
* **Client Case Management** for automating the process in creating, collecting and organizing the registered producers' and their e-waste products' records in place. This will allow the convenient access and a comprehensive view of each registered producer in order to initiate and manage compliance. Moreover, supports improved registration services and back office efficiencies.

#### 3 - Data Verification and Validation

Data verification and validation should be coordinated with all relevant governement authorities and regulatory bodies. For the EPR system, in certain countries, the registration data collated of the e-waste producer and their products by the relevant national registration and licensing authority, is then generally checked by the Ministry of Environment, and against other government databases (eg. ID, tax, chamber of commerce, etc.) in order to fill in any missing gaps, verify and validate collected information, including authentication of all records. \*Data checking approaches also vary: sometimes batch-sharing via _CD, sometimes full interoperability._

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification records.&#x20;
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for cross-referencing and verifying records across multiple registry sources, and reconciling gaps / overlaps.

#### 4 - Payment

The concept of the EPR policy scheme is that an EPR fee is to be paid by each producer who introduces electrical and electronic equipment into the market. The fee to be paid could be proportional to the amount of electrical and electronic equipment introduced into the market. The fee will be used at the end of the product lifecycle to cover the collection, treatment, recycling and awareness raising when it becomes e-waste.

The EPR regulatory framework must clearly spell out which entity will collect the EPR fee, how much the fee is, what the methodology is being used to determine the fee, and how payment should be processed. The methodology should take into account the products put on the market in the previous year (rather than estimated put on the market products in the following year), to ensure greater accuracy. The EPR fee collection stage, in line with the EPR registration process, should take into consideration the other fees currently being requested from producers, or “business operators”.

Countries tend to follow either a Government-led or private sector-led  approach to collecting the EPR fees. In the government-led approach, the EPR fee can be collected on imports at the point of entry by the country's Revenue Authority or EPR Utilities Regulatory Authority, along with other taxes and fees paid during the clearing process. A periodic reconciliation exercise can then take place periodically, where for a given period of time (monthly, quarterly, etc.) the amount of EPR fee collected by the country's Revenue Authority will be transferred to the EPR Regulatory Authority's account.&#x20;

The alternative to a Government-led model is to have the EPR fee paid through a private sector-led not-for-profit (PRO-led) model which collects the EPR fee and gives a recommendation for a producer to obtain the authorization from the Regulatory Authority to import or put electric and electronic equipment on the market.

The only difference between the two models is the entity in charge of collecting and disbursing the funds: in the case of a government-led model, producers are paying to the designated government entity (e.g. Regulatory Authority or other bodies), while in the case of PRO-led model the private sector sets up the legal entity in charge of this, which could be for-profit or not-for-profit.

**Workflows**

* **Financial Services** for processing EPR fee payments by producers.
* **Client Case Management** for identifying, authenticating and monitoring/verifying that the e-waste producers have made the EPR payment and the transaction has been fully processed and received.
