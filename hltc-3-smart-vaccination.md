# HLTC - 3 Smart Vaccination



| ID      | HLTC-3             |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Name    | Smart Vaccination  |
| Sector  | SDG 3              |
| Version | 1.0                |
| Status  | Draft              |

In this use case, smart vaccine technologies are leveraged to improve the management, distribution, and monitoring of vaccines. By integrating digital solutions, data analytics, and connectivity, the aim is to enhance vaccine supply chain efficiency, ensure proper storage and handling, and optimize immunization coverage.

## Stakeholders

* Patients that are included in the vaccine program rollout
* Healthcare agents providing vaccinations to beneficiaries
* Ministry of health or central government body in charge of national health outcomes that are involved in the vaccination program
* Administrators that need to manage payments and/or labs of patients.

## SDG Targets

* The specific SDG targets this use case contributes toward
  * [3.2](https://exchange.dial.global/sdgs/good\_health\_and\_wellbeing): By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and underâ€‘5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
  * [3.3](https://exchange.dial.global/sdgs/good\_health\_and\_wellbeing): By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases

## Steps

### 1- Design digital platform

Implement a digital platform to streamline vaccine management processes. This platform allows for real-time tracking of vaccine inventory, expiration dates, and distribution schedules. It also facilitates efficient ordering and procurement of vaccines based on demand forecasts and historical data

### 2- Supply chain monitoring

Integrate temperature and humidity sensors into vaccine storage units and transportation systems. These sensors continuously monitor and transmit data to ensure proper storage conditions are maintained throughout the cold chain. Any deviations or anomalies trigger alerts, allowing for timely corrective actions.

### 3- Data collection

Utilize digital tools, such as mobile applications or wearable devices, to collect immunization data at the point of care. Health workers can input vaccination details, including patient information, vaccine type, and dosage, directly into the system. This ensures accurate and up-to-date immunization records.

### 4- Demand forecasting

Leverage data analytics and machine learning algorithms to analyze immunization data and population demographics. This helps forecast vaccine demand, identify high-risk areas or populations, and optimize vaccine distribution strategies. Data-driven insights enable proactive planning and resource allocation.

### 5- Program rollout

Deploy mobile vaccine clinics equipped with digital tools for remote and underserved areas. These clinics can access the central vaccine management system, update vaccination records, and synchronize data when connectivity is available. Mobile clinics ensure equitable access to immunization services.

### 6 - Immunization reminders and alerts&#x20;

Utilize SMS notifications or mobile apps to send immunization reminders and alerts to parents or caregivers. These reminders inform them of upcoming vaccination schedules, thereby improving adherence to recommended immunization timelines and reducing missed doses.

### 7 - Payments



### 8 - Ongoing case management



### 9 - Monitoring, evaluation, and learning



Enable real-time monitoring and reporting of immunization coverage, adverse events, and stock levels through a centralized dashboard. Health authorities and program managers can track progress, identify gaps, and address challenges promptly. This data-driven approach enhances decision-making and accountability. (incl. adverse effects monitoring)
