# HLTC-3 - Smart Vaccination



| ID      | HLTC-3             |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Name    | Smart Vaccination  |
| Sector  | SDG 3              |
| Version | 1.0                |
| Status  | Draft              |

A smart vaccine delivery system can revolutionize immunization efforts by enhancing distribution efficiency, optimizing resource utilization, promoting equitable access to vaccines, and ensuring the integrity of the vaccine supply chain. By leveraging digital technologies, smart vaccines can address the challenges associated with traditional vaccine distribution, and can contribute to the global goal of preventing infectious diseases and safeguarding public health.

Seamless vaccine management and execution under compressed timelines requires organizations to automate as much as possible since manual processes are slow, prone to error, and overwhelming for staff. In turn, digital technologies can improve the management, distribution, and monitoring, and timeliness of vaccines. For smooth rollout, end-to-end vaccine management requires vaccine administration management, vaccine allocation, healthcare provider management, vaccine capacity management, transportation storage, and monitoring.

### 4 - Eligibility&#x20;

The system cross-references registration data with eligibility criteria defined by health authorities. Individuals who meet the criteria are notified of their eligibility status either through SMS/USSD mobile technology or through a healthcare practitioner. Eligibility determination for vaccination can happen either before scheduling the appointment or at the start of the vaccination appointment.

### 7 - Supply chain management&#x20;

The system monitors the entire vaccine supply chain, from manufacturing to distribution, ensuring that vaccines are transported and stored within the appropriate temperature and humidity ranges. Real-time alerts are triggered for any deviations, preventing spoilage. While supply chain management has many steps, in this use case we acknowledge that it is necessary to ensure that supply and demand is being met to prevent shortages and or excess supply in any given region.

#### Workflows

* **Supply chain management** to manage the supply from production to vaccination

### 8 - Payment

Some vaccination campaigns may be partially or fully subsidized by the government. In that case, payments may not be required. Otherwise, payments can be collected either pre- or post-consultation. In the context where a digital financial service system is not employed, each beneficiary would be requested to pay via mobile money or to travel to the nearest designated pay-point and pay the fees by program-specific authentication. Money is transferred to the selected payment mechanism and is subsequently verified against the provider. For areas with payment requirements, the system facilitates secure online payment options. It generates digital invoices and receipts, simplifying the financial transaction process.

**Workflows**

* **Financial Services** - for processing vaccination fees
* **Client Case Management** - for identifying and authenticating individual that is making a payment
