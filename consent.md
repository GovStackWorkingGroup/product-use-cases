## 1 Universal Consent Workflows

The workflow BB triggers the need for consent as part of the general business flow. The assumption is that a consenting process never exists outside of a purposeful comprehensive business process. Hence, it is important to define and control the data processing activities as part of a holistic data service. This section lays out key universal consent workflows that can be re-used within the various use-cases (see [explanation in Workflow BB](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIQ756eWauQLNeSWUqfm5dpDz\_wJsesfZgXBiWXLx9w/edit#bookmark=id.r8eld9zgc5tv)). This enforces the best practices for organisations to adhere to personal data processing standards in any given context and jurisdiction. In these sequences, we have removed the Digital Registries BB in the sequence for simplicity. It will store all persistent consent data.

### 1.1 Consenting at initial registration (Pre-registration) using a centralised ID system

The first and somewhat unique use-case is related to the need for consent when the Individual is not yet provisioned in the System processing the data. In such cases, the workflow requires the creation of a valid and trusted Foundational ID to be linked with the Consent Record. Below is shown how a pre-registration use of consent workflow works.

actor Individual
Individual->>+Application: Invoke registration workflow
Application->>+Workflow BB: Trigger registration workflow

note over Workflow BB: Identifies the need for consent

Workflow BB->>+Consent BB: Fetch consent agreement (Registration)
Consent BB-->>-Workflow BB: Returns consent agreement
Workflow BB-->>-Application: Returns consent agreement
Application-->>-Individual: Show consent agreement to fetch data 

note over Individual: The individual agrees<br />to the consent agreement 

Individual->>+Application: Accept consent agreement
Application->>+Foundational ID: Redirect to Foundational ID UI

Foundational ID-->>-Individual: Return Foundational ID authentication UI
Individual->>+Foundational ID: Provide credentials to perform authentication
Foundational ID-->>-Application: Return Foundational ID token (e.g. JWT token) 

note over Application: Foundational ID token recieved<br />is the proof of consent

Application->>+Workflow BB: Fetch data workflow
note right of Workflow BB: Fetch data, <br />For e.g. a population regsitry.

Workflow BB-->>-Application: Confirms the workflow
Application-->>+Workflow BB: Record consent against consent agreement (Foundation ID token, Appl user ID)
Workflow BB-->>+Consent BB: Record consent against the consent agreement
Consent BB-->>-Workflow BB: Return consent ID
Workflow BB-->>-Application: Return consent ID
Application-->>-Individual: Confirm registration

note over Foundational ID: Individual is registered
```



### 1.2 Consenting after the registration (Post-registration)

In more frequent situations, when the Individual is already provisioned in the System (post-registration), the consent workflow use the existing ID tokens, and only the Consent Record is to be created. The following diagram shows how a generic post-registration use of consent works:

#### Universal consent management flow post-registration (uses centralised ID)

actor Individual

note over Individual: The individual is signed in<br />to the application

Individual->>+Application: Invoke a consent agreement workflow
Application->>+Workflow BB: Triggers the consent agreement workflow

Workflow BB->>+Consent Management BB: Fetch consent agreement
Consent Management BB-->>-Workflow BB: Returns consent agreement
Workflow BB-->>-Application: Returns consent agreement
Application-->>-Individual: Shows consent agreement

note over Individual: The individual agrees/disagrees<br />to the consent agreement 

Individual->>+Application: Accepts/Rejects the consent agreement
Application-->>+Workflow BB: Records consent against the consent agreement (Foundation ID token, Application user ID)
Workflow BB-->>+Consent Management BB: Records consent against the consent agreement (Foundation ID token, Application user ID)
Consent Management BB-->>-Workflow BB: Returns consent ID
Workflow BB-->>-Application: Returns consent ID

Application-->>-Individual: Accepts/Rejects the consent agreement
```

### 1.3 Consent Verification

The third universal workflow is about verifying if a valid Consent Record exists or not for a given data processing event within a business process. This may be the immediate continuation of a consenting workflow by the same System that acquired the Consent Record or it may be used by a separate business process by a different Application or at a different moment in time. The same verification workflow may be also used for auditing purposes. The following diagram shows how a generic verification for a valid consent works:

#### Universal consent verification

```mermaid

Application->>+Workflow BB: Triggers the consent verification workflow (consent agreement ID)
note over Application: The Application is in the workflow<br />of processing personal data that<br />requires consent. 

Workflow BB->>+Consent Management BB: Fetch consent ID (consent agreement ID, user ID)
Consent Management BB-->>-Workflow BB: Returns consent record
Workflow BB-->>-Application: Returns consent record

note over Application: Application checks if the consent exists<br />and processes the data based on it
```
