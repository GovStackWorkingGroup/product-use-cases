# Product Use Case

Within the core GovStack Initiative, "product use cases" are used to provide context and limit scope of the various GovStack Building Blocks. These product use cases are considered to be part of GovStack and are versioned and released alongside the Building Block Specifications when a given GovStack release occurs.

Work on these product use cases is organized by the [GovStack Product Committee](https://govstack-global.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PC/pages/35389443/Product+Committee) and is tracked by the [Product project](https://govstack-global.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PRD/boards/25) on the GovStack Jira instance.&#x20;
