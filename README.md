# AGR-1- Market Linkage

### Product Use Case Summary

| ID      | AGR-1          |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Name    | Market Linkage |
| Sector  | Agriculture    |
| Version | 1.0            |
| Status  | Draft          |

This use case profiles the information service delivery and provision of market linkage in the agriculture sector. In this context, market linkage pertains to connecting rural farmers to market information, products, and related services in order to boost productivity, and improve rural incomes and livelihoods. Due to the constraints of their remote location, farmers in remote areas - especially in developing countries, tend to have unequal market power, and poorer access to agricultural production inputs (seeds, fertilizer, and other goods) and services needed to grow their crops and business.

Governments in low- and middle-income countries are increasingly driven to identify sustainable strategies to reduce poverty, stimulate agricultural productivity and increase income of rural famers. One pathway is the implementation of a digital Marketplace platform to: connects buyers and sellers to effectively and efficiently trade goods and services, and support rural farmers with automated notification of harvest schedule, market prices for subscribed products, and weather/natural disaster updates.

### Steps

#### 1 - Outreach Communications

Staff from the Ministry of Agriculture and/or relevant government run agriculture extension institution, organizes an awareness campaign about a Farmers’ Digital Marketplace platform. A platform that connects the core actors in the agricultural value chains (farmers, input suppliers, processors, wholesalers etc.,) - both buyers and sellers - to be able to digitally buy and sell goods, products or services (e.g. transportation service for goods sale).&#x20;

The campaign is spread using digital promotion services, mobile messaging and/or aired on national radio/television to inform the benefits of the Farmers’ Digital Marketplace platform and process to register and creation an account for free of cost. The government extension institution staff will prioritize reach to rural farmers through in-person targeted outreach to rural farms, markets and agribusinesses, to encourage farmers to register on the platform. To address literacy issues and reach more scope, farmers can also learn about the Marketplace by calling a toll-free number to receive more information in their local language and ask any questions they may have.&#x20;

**Workflows**

* **Client communication** to facilitate the spreading of Marketplace awareness to target users and encourage account creation/enrollment via mobile / app/ media channel(s)
* **Client education** for educating potential target beneficiaries about the digital Marketplace platform's approach, objective(s), benefit(s), constraint(s), guideline on platform app usage etc
* **Content management** for the government staff working on the Marketplace platform, to develop and manage training content for farmers on how to use the app and access the free market linkage services
* **Identification and Registration** (with aid of geographic information services tool \*\*\*\* for potential use) in mapping and locating the target users&#x20;
* **Marketplace** as an application workflow (mobile or web) to connect buyer and sellers together and to enable them to transact digitally supported by various other application for authentication, verification and supplementary service provision (e.g. transportation service for goods sale)

#### 2 - Registration

Registration is the process of collecting information of the intended target group (Marketplace platform users) so they can acquire the services being offered. For this use case, a farmer, agriculture input supplier etc, calls a toll-free number to register in the Farmers’ Digital Marketplace. An interactive voice response system (IVRS) operated possibly by a private company, collects basic information of the caller (eg. citizen ID, age, gender) and authenticates the data identity information provided. Once the caller's identity data has been verified, then the caller receives an SMS confirming their registration with a link to download the digital Marketplace mobile application and a first-time user ID and password to create a profile on the platform.

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing responses provided during the registration process
* **Identification and Registration** allows users to register themselves in the Marketplace in order to access the platform and its services. A built-in GPS in the users' main device i.e. mobile phone, automatically captures the user's location data so as to provide location based services
* **Client communication** sends users automated notification of harvest schedule, market prices for subscribed products, and weather/natural disaster updates, transaction-based and promotional information from the Marketplace through digital messaging (e.g. SMS, notification, etc.)&#x20;

#### 3 - Data Verification and Validation

Data is stored with the private company operating the interactive voice response system (IVRS). This private company has a public private partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and/or relevant government run agriculture extension institution to collect the relevant data and facilitate the registration and procurement process of the Marketplace platform. The target user's data that is collected, is automatically checked against other government databases (eg. ID, tax, land cadastre, etc.) in order to fill in any missing gaps, verify and validate collected information, including authentication of all records. Users will only receive a user name and password to create their profile on the Marketplace mobile application once the system verifies and authenticates the registration information they are required to provide. \*Data checking approaches also vary: sometimes batch-sharing via CD, sometimes full interoperability

**Workflows**

* **Client Case Management** for storing and reviewing identification records and tracking of market transactions
* **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence** for cross-referencing and verifying records across multiple registry sources, and reconciling gaps / overlaps

#### 4 - Enrollment

Once the user completes the registration information and the data is authenticated, they receive a link to download a digital Marketplace mobile application as well as their own user ID and password to fully enroll on the platform. After the user installs the mobile app on their smartphone, the user is guided to create their own personalized profile in the digital Marketplace with information on the goods or services they can provide/sell. The purpose of the profile is to facilitate business transactions (e.g. whether a user is a farmer or a agribusiness). In the Marketplace application there is information about prevailing market prices of agricutlural products, goods, and services across different markets.

After users complete their profile in the mobile app, they will receive a list of recommendations of products and services that may be of most interest to them based on their profile, location and other factors. Users will also have the ability to use the word and image search function in the Marketplace, to look for a product and see a listing of different sellers who are selling the product, goods etc, in different markets. Sellers and buyers should be able to communicate and message each other on the platform. This Marketplace platform application should be in practice, a tailored software application that supports users management functions (e.g. enrollment, profile creation, search engine, pricing, procurement, payments, messaging etc.).

**Workflows**

* **Data Collection and Reporting** for capturing the personalized profile information of all registerd users on the platform
* **Financial Services** for staging users' account details for payment transfer processing
* **Identification and Registration** for identifying users and confirming enrollment/completed creation of a profile
* **Client Case Management** for tracking all business transactions

#### 5 - Payment

To facilitate transactions/payments between buyers and sellers, the Farmers' Marketplace platform can have an in-built payment function in the application. Sellers pricing for each products and/or services are listed on the Marketplace. As a payment service option, users can enter their Universal Payment Interface ID (UPI-ID) of their bank account to make or receive payments. For instance, if a buyer is interested in buying a specific product, they can search for the product in the Marketplace and find different sellers who are selling the product in different markets, the pricing they are offering and the quality assurance report on the sellers goods or products. Once the buyer finds a seller that meets their pricing and need, they can directly contact the seller, negotiate pricing and share the product delivery location with the seller. If the seller agrees to deliver the product at the buyer's location and the pricing is agreed by both parties, then the payment process can be facilitated.&#x20;

The first step of the payment process is that the buyer enters their Universal Payment Interface ID (UPI-ID) of their bank account to make the payment, and once the payment has gone through, the buyer receives a SMS informing them of the transaction with an authentication code, which has to be shared with the delivery person when the product/good is delivered. Another SMS is sent to the seller informing the remittance. The money is deposited in to an Escrow Account managed by a financial service provider, which holds the final remittance to the seller until the physical deliver happens successfully. Once the delivery process has succeeded, the seller then receives the payment.

**Workflows**

* **Financial Services** to facilitate financial transactions between buyers and sellers in order to conclude the buy-sale process
* **Client Case Management** for identifying and authenticating individual that is making a withdrawal, or to recall / verify deposit account information prior to payment transaction
* **Procurement:** buyers and sellers in the Marketplace procure via a Procurement workflow the goods and services from each other by negotiating transactional terms and conditions (e.g. price, delivery time etc.)
* **Supply-chain Management**: Ensuring the physical delivery of the goods and services being transacted in digital Marketplace and monitoring when the actual supply of goods or service happens physically&#x20;
